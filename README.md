## Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the passengers' demographics and survival patterns. The dataset contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic.

## Project Goals

- Understand the passenger demographics on the Titanic.
- Analyze survival patterns based on different factors.
- Visualize key insights from the data.

## Data Source

The Titanic dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, we performed the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration.
2. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values.
3. Descriptive Statistics and Summary Metrics.
4. Data Visualization to Understand Patterns.

## Project Files

The main files in this project are:

- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with EDA code
- `titanic.csv`: Titanic dataset

## Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `EDA of Titanic Passenger Data.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.
